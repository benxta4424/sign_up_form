In this project i implemented basic form features such as: adding inputs and their labels,submit button and validations!
The website is optimized for zoom-in/zoom-out scenarios as well. 
I didnt implement the same optimizations for the form as well in case the user needs to zoom in to put his/hers data in.

A cool feature added as well, when the Log IN button is hovered, another button is appearing.
The creation of the hovered button is done with the pseudo-element 'after'.
We create the button with after and use 'transform(0)' to hide it and use 'transform(1)' when hovered in order to show it.
